How the upcoming page works. For the competition you want as upcoming, choose “upcoming” from the dropdown menu when editing a competition. There is also a new field called “Text Preview” (both english and chinese) that is used as the description for the upcoming event. I removed the contestants from the upcoming event page (I was confused whether that was needed) - the code is just commented out so it’s easy to add back in.

*Don’t publish competitions without completing all the basic fields!!*
